## Dougscore Ratings
So how does the DougScore work? 

```
There are 10 separate categories, and they’re each judged on a scale of 1 through 10 — 
with “1” being the worst, and “10” being the best, meaning the highest possible DougScore is 100. 
The ten categories are split into two separate groups: “Weekend” and “Daily.” 
The “Weekend” categories measure a car’s appeal to enthusiasts; in other words, how much fun it would be to drive on the weekend. 
The “Daily” categories, meanwhile, focus on a car’s livability and practicality.
```

## Excel Cleaning and Data Prep

Doug has his excel file with some pretty unique Formatting.

↘️ example

I took this into Excel, Removed the formatting. Took out some of the cells I wont use. And used 'Concat' to join the location Data into a single column.
